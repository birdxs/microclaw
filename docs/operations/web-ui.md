# Local Web UI and Gateway

MicroClaw serves a local management UI and API when `web_enabled: true`. The default address is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:10961
```

The UI reads sessions from the same SQLite store used by chat channels. It can create Web sessions, inspect cross-channel history, clear context, manage tasks and settings, and show governance and learning state. Sessions originating on non-Web channels remain read-only in the Web UI by default.

## First sign-in

If no operator password exists, MicroClaw initializes a temporary password and asks you to replace it after sign-in. Manage the password from the CLI:

```sh
microclaw web
microclaw web password <value>
microclaw web password-generate
microclaw web password-clear
```

Changing or clearing the password revokes existing Web login sessions.

## Bind address and exposure

The default loopback bind is intended for local access. Before binding to a non-loopback interface:

1. Set a strong operator password and scoped API keys.
2. Put TLS and appropriate network access control in front of the service.
3. Review the [secure runtime](../security/secure-runtime.md) and [Web security audit](../security/audit-2026-07-web-ui-clawhub.md).
4. Keep hook tokens separate from operator API keys.

Relevant top-level settings include `web_enabled`, `web_host`, and `web_port`. Use the [generated config defaults](../generated/config-defaults.md) and [`microclaw.config.example.yaml`](../../microclaw.config.example.yaml) for current values.

## HTTP, SSE, and hooks

The Web surface supports synchronous chat, asynchronous runs with SSE replay, and OpenClaw-compatible hooks. The canonical operations guide for payloads, authentication, session routing, and curl examples is [HTTP request triggers](http-hook-trigger.md).

Common entry points include:

- `POST /api/send` for a synchronous run
- `POST /api/send_stream` for an asynchronous run
- `GET /api/stream?run_id=<id>` for SSE replay
- `POST /hooks/agent` for an authenticated agent hook
- `POST /hooks/wake` for a system-event wake trigger

Web API calls that mutate state require an API key with the appropriate scope. `/hooks/*` uses the dedicated `channels.web.hooks_token` setting and rejects requests when no hook token is configured.

## WebSocket gateway

The OpenClaw Mission Control-compatible bridge upgrades WebSocket connections at `GET /`.

The basic handshake is:

1. Connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:10961/`.
2. Wait for `connect.challenge`.
3. Send a `connect` request with the operator API key in `params.auth.token`.
4. Use bridge methods such as `chat.send`, `chat.history`, `sessions.list`, `sessions.send`, `sessions.spawn`, `sessions.kill`, `models.list`, and `config.get`.
5. Consume `chat` events until a terminal `final` or `error` event arrives.

For a quick local check:

```sh
MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=mc_... microclaw gateway call health
MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=mc_... microclaw gateway call status
```

Connection settings can be supplied with `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`, `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_HOST`, `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, and `MICROCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. OpenClaw-compatible aliases are also supported.

## Concurrency behavior

Web streamed runs, scheduled jobs, reflector passes, and session-native subagents use separate async lanes. Each chat still serializes turns, while safe read-only tool calls can run in parallel waves inside a turn. Mid-turn user messages can be injected into the active loop when enabled.

See [Concurrency and responsiveness](concurrency-and-responsiveness.md) for limits and tuning.

## Troubleshooting

- Run `microclaw doctor` before changing configuration.
- Check `microclaw gateway status --json` for service state.
- Use `microclaw gateway logs 200` for recent service logs.
- If hooks return `503`, configure `channels.web.hooks_token` and restart.
- If a container cannot reach a host-side dependency, remember that `127.0.0.1` refers to the container itself.

The broader recovery and backup workflow is in the [operations runbook](runbook.md).
